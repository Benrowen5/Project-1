## What Should I Watch
Team project to develop a real-world front-end application.

## Description:</br>
Our group developed a random movie generator application that will provide 4 random movies based on user input / selection criteria (genre, movie score, and MPAA rating). The app provides users with a user-friendly layout with self explanatory prompts for selecting movie search criteria, as well as final display of movie results for the user. The code has been written to maintain readability, organization, and context. A unique repository was created to store the project and deploy the application.</br></br>
